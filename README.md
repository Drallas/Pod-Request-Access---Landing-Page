### What I learned

Learning more about the utility of Linear Gradients. The mobile layout for this challenge has a darkened background Image. I first extracted the hex for the color to darken the image from Figma and 'converted' (too easy in VSCode) it to HSLA values. The value from Figma seems a bit too light so i increased value.

```css
background: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)), url('landingpagepic.jpg');

```
### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [How to Background Image](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/css/how+to+darken+background+image+with+css) - This helped me to create the mobile darkened Background-Image.
